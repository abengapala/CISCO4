ðŸ“¡ Cisco Network Infrastructure Project
This project showcases a comprehensive Cisco Packet Tracer network simulation designed to model a secure, scalable, and manageable enterprise network. It includes multiple core networking concepts and technologies covered in Cisco CCNA 4 (Enterprise Networking, Security, and Automation).

ðŸ”§ Key Features
VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing:
Logical segmentation of the network into VLANs with inter-VLAN communication facilitated via router-on-a-stick or Layer 3 switch configuration.

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):
Dynamic routing protocol configured across multiple routers to enable efficient, loop-free path selection and scalable routing between network segments.

AAA with TACACS+ Server:
Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting configured using a TACACS+ server to enforce secure administrative access control.

Telnet and SSH Access:
Remote management of networking devices using secure and basic access methods with appropriate username/password configuration.

Static Routing:
Manual routing setup between certain segments of the network for redundancy and route control.

DHCP Server Configuration:
Centralized dynamic IP address assignment across various VLANs.

Basic Device Configuration:
Includes hostname assignment, password protection, interface IP addressing, banners, and other essential settings.

Network Security Best Practices:

Port security and switch security

Strong device access policies

Secure remote access protocols (SSH preferred)

AAA authentication mechanisms

Additional Features:

DNS and Web Server integration

File Server and Client-PC interaction

Comprehensive topology with multiple routers, switches, servers, and PCs
